    <description>This workout contains 4 x very mild ramps from Zone 2 to Zone 3, however each ramp is to be ridden at a low cadence of 60rpm, adding a strength element to the workout. Rather than being a strenuous strength endurance workout in its own right, todays efforts further your strength training experience.</description>
