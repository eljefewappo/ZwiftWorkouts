    <description>This session aims to replicate the demands of a mountain bike ride / event. 

Mountain biking generally involves far more variations in effort compared with road riding - so plenty of surges and time spent being over geared!

We touch upon all of these aspects in todays session, as we ramp our effort up at a low cadence to replicate climbing a technical section, picking our way around rocks, before a Z4 effort on a fire road, before heading back in to the forest and up a really steep technical section where once again we are forced to ride at an uncomfortably low cadence, in the saddle! </description>
